            "Okay, I need to help a customer who's having trouble logging into customer.io from their work computer. Let me think through the possible issues and solutions step by step.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, network issues could be a problem. Sometimes work networks block certain sites. I should suggest trying a different network, like a mobile hotspot, to see if that works. That's a common first step in troubleshooting.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, account lockout is a possibility if they've entered the wrong password multiple times. I should remind them to look for any messages about their account being locked and guide them to reset their password if that's the case.\n",
            "\n",
            "MFA issues might also be causing the problem. If they're using multi-factor authentication, maybe their authenticator app isn't working correctly. I should advise them to check the app and offer to contact support to bypass MFA temporarily if needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "They should also check if their account is active. If they're not sure, contacting their administrator would be a good next step.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearing the browser cache and cookies can often resolve login issues. I should include that as a troubleshooting step, as it's a simple fix that users can try on their own.\n",
            "\n",
            "If all else fails, trying a different device might help determine if the issue is specific to their work computer. This could indicate a problem with the device's settings or browser.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, if none of these steps work, they should reach out to customer.io support for further assistance. It's important to reassure them that we're here to help and can look into the issue more deeply.\n",
            "\n",
            "Putting this all together, I'll structure the response in a friendly and conversational tone, making sure each step is clear and easy to follow. I'll avoid any technical jargon that might confuse them and ensure they feel supported throughout the process.\n",
            "</think>\n",
